This is a simple interpreter I am writing to learn more about how interpreters work.
I am following the book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/" target="_blank"> Crafting Interpreters </a> by Bob Nystrom. The book is in java but I am writing the interpreter in Go and adding some features of my own.

- Running the interpreter

```
go run .
```

I wrote this specifically dedicating it to Rashu.
